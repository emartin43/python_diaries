### A series where I detail my experiences, thoughts, and struggles learning Python as an R user.

## Python Diaries 1 -- Large Pumpkins :jack_o_lantern:

In this first installment of the Python Diaries, I take a look at a global dataset from The Great Pumpkin Commonwealth on large pumpkins. 

### My goal for this project:
Get a feel for how Python works and do a little bit of exploratory data analysis in a low-stakes environment. 

### Skills I practiced in this project:
- Creating a Jupyter Notebook 
- Importing a .csv file
- Installing and importing packages (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) 
- Cleaning data 
- Manipulating data
- Running basic inferential statistical analysis 
- Summarizing data
- Visualizing data 
  - Histogram
  - Bar chart 
  - Box plot 


### General reflections: 
As primarily an R user, there were some differences that stood out to me after getting to know Python for a little bit. Firstly, with R there is primarily one IDE that manages and executes R code, which is RStudio. While there are a few other alternatives for RStudio, they don't compare to the number of IDEs, text editors, and notebooks available for Python code. I decided to run my Python code in Jupyter Notebook because I read that it is commonly used in data science and also proof of knowledge exercises. However, I plan on testing out other IDEs, etc. to manage and execute Python code. 

In general, the language differences between R and Python is akin to the differences between Spanish and Portuguese. The languages are close enough whereas I can get by in Python and understand the fundementals of what I am doing, but I would still need to refer to guides in order to execute the code correctly. There are also smaller "grammatical" differences between the two languages where R uses "<-" as the assignment operator and Python uses "=". 

Lastly, it seems that from my research that people tend to say that R is "intuitive" and best for "statistical analyses" and "data science" while Python is best for "production" and it will give you real "programming skills". From the getgo, R seemed more intuitive to me in the beginning than Python has so far. However, I do not want to make any hard core judgement statements until I have some more experience with Python using it in difference contexts, i.e., visualizations, statistics, machine learning, etc.
