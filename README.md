### A series where I detail my experiences, thoughts, and struggles learning Python as an R user.

## Python Diaries 1 -- Large Pumpkins :jack_o_lantern:

In this first installment of the Python Diaries, I take a look at a global dataset from The Great Pumpkin Commonwealth on large pumpkins. 

### My goal for this project:
Get a feel for how Python works and do a little bit of exploratory data analysis in a low-stakes environment. 

### Skills I practiced in this project:
- Creating a Jupyter Notebook 
- Importing a .csv file
- Installing and importing packages (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) 
- Cleaning data 
- Manipulating data
- Summarizing data
- Visualizing data 
  - Histogram
  - Bar chart 
  - Box plot 


### General reflections: 
As primarily an R user, there were some differences that stood out to me after getting to know Python for a little bit. Firstly, with R there is primarily one IDE that manages and executes R code, which is RStudio. While there are a few other alternatives for RStudio, they don't compare to the number of IDEs, text editors, and notebooks available for Python code. I decided to run my Python code in Jupyter Notebook because I read that it is commonly used in data science and also proof of knowledge exercises. However, I plan on testing out other IDEs, etc. to manage and execute Python code. 

In general, the language differences between R and Python is akin to the differences between Spanish and Portuguese. The languages are close enough whereas I can get by in Python and understand the fundamentals of what I am doing, but I would still need to refer to guides in order to execute the code correctly. There are also smaller "grammatical" differences between the two languages where R uses "<-" as the assignment operator and Python uses "=". 

Lastly, it seems that from my research that people tend to say that R is "intuitive" and best for "statistical analyses" and "data science" while Python is best for "production" and it will give you real "programming skills". From the get-go, R seemed more intuitive to me in the beginning than Python has so far. However, I do not want to make any hard-core judgment statements until I have some more experience with Python using it in different contexts, i.e., visualizations, statistics, machine learning, etc. 

### What I want to learn for next time:
It would be really handy to learn how to add comments to code in Juptyer Notebook. While this first notebook is a bit messy without comments, I hope that my goal and intentions in this elementary stage of learning Python still comes through.

## Python Diaries 2 -- Solitary Confinement in Detention Facilities 

In this second installment of the Python Diaries, I analyze solitary confinement data in detention facilities from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) report "Solitary Voices". 

### My goal for this project:
Practice the Python skills I was introduced to in Python Diaries #1 and feel more comfortable with them.

### Skills I practiced in this project:
- Creating a Jupyter Notebook 
- Importing a .csv file
- Installing and importing packages (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) 
- Cleaning data 
- Manipulating data
- Summarizing data
- Visualizing data 
  - Histogram
  - Bar chart 
  - Box plot 
- Creating comments 
- Setting data display formatting 
- Subsetting Data 


### General reflections: 
After the last Python Diaries, I wanted to immediately jump into geospatial analysis or linear regressions, but I realized that it would be better to become more comfortable with basic Python concepts first before moving on to something more complicated. 

I was so excited to dive into the world of data science and learn all the cool libraries and techniques. But I quickly realized that before I could even think about using those libraries, I needed to have a strong understanding of the basics. When it comes to data science, just like many STEM fields, understanding the basics is like the foundation of a house. If the foundation is weak, the rest of the house will crumble. But with a strong foundation, it's possible to build anything. 

It was really rewarding to work with this dataset because of all the potential ways it can be used to help people and communities. Data science can be a powerful tool for promoting social good, especially when it comes to analyzing complex issues such as solitary confinement in detention facilities. By using techniques like machine learning and statistical analysis, data scientists can uncover patterns and insights that might otherwise go unnoticed. For example, in the context of solitary confinement, data science can be used to analyze large amounts of data on the conditions and outcomes of this practice, such as the length of time individuals spend in isolation, the impact on their mental health, and the correlation between solitary confinement and recidivism. This information can be used to inform policy and advocacy efforts aimed at reducing the use of solitary confinement and improving conditions for those who are incarcerated. Additionally, data science can also be used to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts over time.


### What I want to learn for next time:
Next time, I want to take my Python skills to the next level by tinkering with geospatial data or running simple linear regressions.
